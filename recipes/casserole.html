    <p>This wonderful dish combines all things Oktoberfest! It has spaetzle 
            and sausage, and <br>the sauerkraut is flavored with bacon, brown sugar, 
            apples, and sauteed onions. Yum! This dish <br>reheats well the next day 
            and is very filling!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1/3 cup water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1/2 large onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 small Gala apple, cored and chopped</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package sauerkraut</li>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) package kielbasa sausage, cut into 2 inch pieces</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a metal colander</li>
            <li>Whisk together the flour and salt in a bowl. Mix the eggs and water, and 
                pour into the flour mixture. Stir to form a dough.</li>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Place the spaetzle dough into the oiled 
                colander, and set the colander over the pot of water. <br>Use a flexible 
                spatula to push the dough into the boiling water through the holes in 
                the colander. Stir the spaetzle as they boil. <br>When they have floated to 
                the top, they are done (about 5 minutes). Scoop the spaetzle out of the 
                boiling water, and place into <br>an ungreased 9x9-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place the bacon in a skillet over medium heat, and cook, stirring often, 
                until the bacon is crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove bacon, <br>leaving drippings 
                in pan, and set aside. Cook the onion in the same pan as the bacon until 
                browned, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet, melt the butter over medium heat until foamy, and stir 
                in the apple and brown sugar. Cook and stir until the apple <br>is soft, about 
                5 minutes. Transfer the cooked bacon, onions, and sauerkraut into the skillet, 
                and cook, stirring often, until the flavors <br>have blended, about 5 minutes. Pour 
                the sauerkraut mixture into the 9x9-inch baking dish on top of the spaetzle.</li>
            <li>Place the kielbasa pieces into a microwave-safe dish, and cook on full power in 
                a microwave oven until the sausage is hot and has <br>lost its pink color, 2 or 3 
                minutes. Transfer the sausage to the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
