            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Husks and Dough:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package dried corn husks</li>
            <li>2/3 cups lard</li>
            <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can of beef broth, or as needed</li>
            <li>2 cups masa harina</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Make filling: Place pork, onion, and garlic in a Dutch 
                oven. Add enough water to cover and bring to a boil. <br>Reduce 
                heat to low and simmer until pork is cooked through, about 2 
                hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, make chile sauce: Use rubber gloves to remove stems 
                and seeds from chiles. Place chiles in a saucepan <br>with 2 cups water. 
                Simmer, uncovered, for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and cool.</li>
            <li>Transfer chiles and cooking water to a blender and blend until smooth. 
                Strain mixture into a bowl and stir in salt. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Shred cooked pork and mix in 1 cup chile sauce. Reserve remaining sauce 
                for serving.</li>
            <li>Prepare husks and dough: Soak corn husks in a bowl of warm water until 
                softened, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While the husks are soaking, beat lard with 1 tablespoon broth until fluffy. 
                Combine masa harina, baking powder, and salt in a <br>separate bowl; stir into 
                the lard mixture, adding more broth as needed to form a spongy dough.</li>
            <li>Remove husks from water and pat dry. Spread dough out over husks to 1/4- to 
                1/2-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Place 1 tablespoon pork filling over center of each. Fold the sides, top, 
                and bottom of each husk in toward the center to enclose dough.</li>
            <li>Arrange tamales in a steamer basket. Place over simmering water and steam for 
                1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove tamales from husks. Drizzle with remaining chile sauce and top with 
                sour cream, or mix sour cream into chile sauce first for a creamy sauce.</li>
        </ol>
