    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian Sausage</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 slices of bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large onion diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
            <li>6 potatoes thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1/4 bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
        </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the italian sausage and red pepper flakes in 
                a Dutch oven over medium-high heat <br>
                until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink 10-15 minutes. 
                Drain and set aside.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>Cook the bacon in the same Dutch oven until crisp, about 10
                minutes.  Drain, leaving a few tablespoons <br> of drippings with
                the bacon in the bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in the onions
                and garlic; cook until onions <br> are soft and translucent, about
                5 minutes.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>Pour the chicken broth into the Dutch oven with the bacon and onion
                mixture; bring to a boil over high heat. <br>Add the potatoes, and boil
                until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium and stir 
                in the heavy cream <br>and cooked sausage; heat through. Mix the spinach
                into the soup just before serving.
            </li>
        </ol>
